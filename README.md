# MIT-AJL-Team1

Project Overview: 
The project aims to increase awareness for the harmful social implications of AI and reduce significant discriminatory threats. 

Real World Impact: 
The model should classify skin conditions across diverse skin tones to increase fairness in dermatology and ensure that historically underrepresented groups deserve fair treatment. 

Overall Team Goals:
- Create working model first then fine tune for optimization.
- Achieve top 10 rank
- Everyone works on things they are familiar and unfamiliar with 


Equitable AI for Dermatology Team 1

- pre-processing.ipynb. This notebook checks the original data, and does some basic exploration. Then it augments the images in the trianing dataset to provide mor training images.

- training.ipynb. In this notebook a CNN model is prepared and trained.

- my_model.h5. Saves the model and its paramters to make it easier to load in the future (no need to train it everytime).

- predictions.csv. A Csv file of the model's predictions, what we would submit).
